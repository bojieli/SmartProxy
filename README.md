SmartProxy
----------

If you have two machines in different ISPs, and they are in one subnet (i.e, have layer-2 connectivity), this tool can be used to make one of them as server and the other as client, and route through different ISPs according to IP range table of ISPs.

The scripts are dedicated for USTC LUG server network. You have to modify them to fit in your networking environment.

The ultimate goal of this project is to build a generic tool for adaptive proxy tunnel selection. It is hard, but the conversation can begin.
